/**
 * Send email after release done.
 *
 * @author Yuriy Alevohin (alevohin@mail.ru)
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 2.0
 * @todo #748 Implement Mails agent. Similar to what we do in CommentsTag
 *  we should do here - send an email to all listed addresses. The body of
 *  the email should contain similar text to what we create for the tag
 *  comment. Postman's parameters are stored in Manifest.MF. We need 4
 *  parameters: Rultor-SMTPHost, Rultor-SMTPPort, Rultor-SMTPUsername,
 *  Rultor-SMTPPassword. New instance of Mails must be created at Agents,
 *  after CommentsTag.
 * @todo #748 Describe in file 2014-07-13-reference.md config parameters for
 *  email after release and how it works shortly. Config format described
 *  in issue #748.
