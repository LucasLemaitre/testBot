QnHello.intro=Hi there! I understand a few simple commands: \
    "merge", "deploy", etc. \
    [This page](https://doc.rultor.com/basics.html) \
    explains them briefly. Any questions or bug reports \

    Check [this page](https://doc.rultor.com/basics.html) and try again please

ClosePullRequest.explanation=Rultor closed this pull request for you because \
    your .rultor.yml specified the use of rebasing before merging. GitHub does \
    not mark rebased pull requests as merged, because rebasing entails a \
    change in commit hashes. Nevertheless all your files have been merged \
    exactly as they would have been merged without the rebase option set.
