  completely isolating them and making  fully configurable.

Rultor runs every build in its
own [Docker](http://www.docker.io) container.
This approach has [multiple benefits](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/29/docker-in-rultor.html).

First of all, you can easily reproduce Rultor errors
on your own machine. Just install Docker, start
a container from `yegor256/rultor` image, and run your build inside it.
You will get exactly the same output as you see in Rultor logs.

This is how you start a container locally:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo docker run -it --rm yegor256/rultor /bin/bash
{% endhighlight %}

Second, the usage of Docker containers makes it possible to create
complex builds much faster. When your build requires a lot
of heavyweight prerequisites (for example apt-get packages
or Maven dependencies), you don't have to wait for them on every
build. Instead, create your own Docker image, install everything
in it and publish it to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Then, configure your [`.rultor.yml`]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-reference %})
to use your own Docker image and enjoy fast builds.

Inside the Docker container your scripts are executed
by the user `r`, with its home in `/home/r`.

[Docker's usage in every build](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/29/docker-in-rultor.html).
