[Rultor](https://www.rultor.com) is a DevOps team assistant.
It helps your programmers and release managers automate
[routine operations]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-basics %}),
with an easy-to-use intuitive interface:

 * **Merging** of pull requests (ensures that builds remain clean)

 * **Deploying** to production and stage environments

 * **Releasing** and tagging

To start working with Rultor, all you need to do
is give him [commands]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-14-commands %})
via one of your Github tickets.
Try a simple `@rultor hello` and see how it works.

Rultor is not a replacement, but rather a powerful addition
to your existing continuous integration solution, like
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/),
[Go](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery),
[Travis](http://www.travis-ci.org),
[Drone](http://www.drone.io),
[Snap](http://www.snap-ci.io),
[Codeship](http://www.codeship.io) or
[Wercker](http://wercker.com/).

Rultor is absolutely free, both for open source and commercial projects.
It is sponsored by [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com).

[CloudBees](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/25/deploy-to-cloudbees.html).

Yeah, BTW, every build runs in its own
[Docker]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-docker %})
container! :)
